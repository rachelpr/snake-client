# Snake-Client Project

The original Snake game is a video game concept where the player manoeuvres a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth manoeuvres. The goal is to grow the snake to become as long as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

The version of the game we will build in our project is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

This is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Instructions
- Run the snake client using  `node play.js` with a command line arg of your initials 
- Use WASD keys to move the snake up, left ,down, or right
- Goal is to get your snake to eat as many red dots as possible
- Use keys "e" "r" "t" or "f" to send pre-canned messages
- The game is over when you crash into a wall, or into your own tail
- The game can be exited by using the `ctrl - c` keyboard shortcut
